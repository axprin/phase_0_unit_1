# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.<br><br>
* I think web standards are important, so things look consistent and operate the same way regardless of what browser or device you are using. 
* I do like the new HTML5 elements, because they make help to make responsive capabilities possible. 
* The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on. 
* I think I've used pretty much all of the standard browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera and Safari). I think it isn't good when websites do not look/operate the same way across different browsers, that is what reset.css files are out to eliminate.
