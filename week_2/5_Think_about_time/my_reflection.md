# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?<br><br>
* My biggest time management challenge during Phase 0 is easily time in general. Working 45+ hours a week, plus all of the work and reading we are expected to do for Phase 0 really puts a strain on my sanity level. I'm still working on how best to manage this, but so far I have found that setting time aside, every night, even if just for a few minutes, has proven to be helpful this week. I find that I work better in long bursts, rather than short bursts, so it is more ideal if I have more time to work with, but given my situation and the time requirement by DBC, sometimes I just can't help that. As Phase 0 goes on, I'd like to try my hardest to get the assignments done as soon as possible in the week, so I can do the additional activities and self imposed research that I want to.
