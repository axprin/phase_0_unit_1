# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.<br><br>
* DOM is kinda like the skeleton of a webpage. In Chrome, you can right click on a website, and hit inspect element and see how the HTML and CSS construct a page and where the Javascript comes in. It also allows for on the go editing (content and styles), which can be incredibly helpful when working on a website's design. When inspecting element and comparing my page against a wordpress page, I noticed that the wordpress page seemed to use a lot of GUIDs. All in all, I foundt Chrome Dev Tools to be really helpful in both understanding how a website is constructed/works and for on the fly design purposes. It's also fun to change content on cnn.com, making headlines funny and entertaining.
