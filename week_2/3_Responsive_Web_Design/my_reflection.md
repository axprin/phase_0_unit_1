# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.<br><br>
* Responsive web design is when a page changes styles or other characteristics based on how large the browser is. I think it's a great idea, because nowadays, people access the internet with all sorts of different devices with different resolutions and browsers, this allows everything to be on "the same page." I think in the future, things will keep getting developed in this fashion, it makes more sense and it's way more usable. I'm not sure how visually impared people would use the web, I'd imagine we aren't too far off from a "monitor" that you would feel (via Brialle or something), but I am unsure. I know there are accessibility options where you can have your computer audibly dictate things to the user. I think responsive web design is really the the next big thing in web design and things will only continue to become more and more robust.
