// User Stories
// 1. I want to create a function called 'sum'
// 2. I want function 'sum' to calculate the total of all numbers in an array
// 3. I want function 'sum' to calculate the total of all numbers in an array
// 4. I want to create a function called 'mean' 
// 5. I want function 'mean' to calculate the sum of an array, then divide it by the length of the array
// 6. I want function 'mean' to calculate the sum of an array, then divide it by the length of the array
// 7. I want to create a function called 'median'
// 8. If the array length is odd, I want function 'median' to return the exact middle value of the array
// 9. If the array length is even, I want function 'median' to return the sum of the middle two numbers of the array then divide it by 2

// Reflection
// I thought this was a pretty interesting approach to group programming. Since I was first, I had the very simple task of deciphering the objectives into user stories. From that, we had Johnny use my user stories to build pseudocode, where we had Celeen and Neel work to write the actual code and then I got the finished code to test. I thought we all did our parts in a reasonable manner, with really no hiccups. This was a good experience for me, but I think I could benefit more from a more technically challenging role next time. Personally, I didn't undestand much of a difference between writing user stories and pseudocode. In the future, I think those could be condensed into one single step, where user stories is like your mental thought process, and pseudocode is the written down end-goal you are trying to achieve through the code you are writing.
