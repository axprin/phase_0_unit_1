// I worked by myself on this challenge

// Your mission description:
// Run the soldier out into a field full of ogres
// Yell something to catch their attention/taunt them
// Run to the other side of the field and meet up with the rest of your crew
// Yell "Follow Me!" to get your crew to follow you
// Approach the ogres
// Yell "ATTACK!" to get your crew to attack

// Pseudocode
// Move soldier out to coordinates (50, 50)
// Promt soldier to yell "Hey you sissies!"
// Move soldier to coordinates (75, 90)
// Prompt soldier to yell "Follow Me!"
// Move solier to coordinates (65, 50)
// Prompt soldier to yell "ATTACK!"
// KILL ALL THE OGRES!

// Initial Code
this.moveXY(50, 50);
this.say("Hey, you sissies!");
this.moveXY(75, 90); 
this.say("Follow Me!");
this.moveXY(65, 50); 
this.say("ATTACK!");

// Refactored Code
// Not needed - the code is pretty simple and and there isn't a lot of room to clean it up.

// Reflection
// 
// Like my reflection for the first exercise of this week, I thought this challenge was a little elementary and doesn't teach the foundational point of JavaScript the way I thought it should be expressed. Perhaps I understood the challenge wrong, but I don't see the point of how or why this would better me as a programmer. Nevertheless, it was a pretty open-ended challenge and allowed us to be as fun and creative as we wanted (amidst the pretty serious workload of phase 0, which I can always appreciate.)
